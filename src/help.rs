Usage:
  looop                          run the pulse (foreground; Ctrl-C to stop)
  looop run <goal-id>            run ONE goal NOW (manual override): a forced,
                                goal-focused move, ignoring priority order and
                                the world-unchanged skip; works while the pulse
                                runs. <goal-id> = goals/<id>.md basename.
                                e.g. looop run setup ; looop run morning-standup
  looop tick                     run a single beat and exit (debug / cron)
  looop status [--json]          structured snapshot of the loop's live state
                                (pulse, last tick, workers, cost) — for an
                                external observer / AI watching the loop
  looop ls [--json] [--watch] [--interval <dur>]
                                list this profile's worker sessions (⚑ = waiting),
                                in-process; --watch refreshes live (Ctrl-C to stop)
  looop start-session <id> "<prompt>" [runner]
                                start a worker session (used by the tick AI)
  looop attach <id>              attach your terminal to a worker (in-process;
                                detach with Ctrl-\ Ctrl-\)
  looop kill <id>                terminate a worker session
  looop flag <id> [message]      raise a worker's attention flag
  looop unflag <id>              clear a worker's attention flag
  looop prune                    clear finished worker corpses (the pulse also
                                does this every tick)
  looop cost [today|all|--json]   report LLM spend recorded in the cost ledger
                                (ticks + manual goal runs are metered
                                automatically; workers self-report via
                                'looop _cost')
  looop version                  print the looop version
  looop help                     show this help

Paths (override via env LOOOP_CONFIG / LOOOP_DATA_DIR):
  config  {config}
  data    {data}

looop is a single self-contained binary: the worker fleet (babysit) is linked
as a LIBRARY and driven entirely in-process — no `babysit` executable required.
looop scopes the fleet to this profile automatically.
  looop ls                      list worker sessions (⚑ = waiting for you)
  looop ls --watch              watch the fleet live, in place
  looop attach <id>             enter a waiting session and talk to it
  looop kill <id>               end a session ; looop flag/unflag <id> ; looop prune

The pulse launches each worker in the data dir; if a worker needs to touch code
it provisions its OWN sandbox (box if available, else git worktree), as told by
the PLAYBOOK. looop itself has no notion of repos.

Fix judgment by editing PLAYBOOK.md (in the data dir) and committing — it takes
effect next tick."#,
        config = paths.config.display(),
        data = paths.data_dir.display(),
    );
}
