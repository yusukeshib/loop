//! The single clap-derived front door for the whole CLI.
//!
//! Every verb — the human/client surface (`up`, `down`, `watch`) and the
//! machine-facing `_` plumbing (steer verbs + worker self-callbacks) — is
//! declared here as typed args. clap owns parsing, so we
//! get, uniformly and for free across every verb:
//!   • `--help`/`-h` on every subcommand (and it is NON-destructive: `_ playbook
//!     write --help` prints help instead of writing the literal text `--help`,
//!     which is the accident this migration closes);
//!   • rejection of unknown/mistyped flags (exit 1) instead of silently writing
//!     or ignoring them;
//!   • the `--` end-of-options convention, so a body that genuinely starts with
//!     `--` is still expressible (`… write -- --literal`).
//!
//! Free-form bodies (goal/sensor/playbook/answer/worker-prompt) are modeled as a
//! variadic positional `Vec<String>`; the `-`/heredoc → stdin convention is
//! resolved AFTER parsing by `executor::resolve_body`. A lone `-` stays a
//! sentinel; `a - b` keeps the dash as content (clap treats a bare `-` as a
//! value, not a flag).
//!
//! NOT modeled here on purpose: the hidden `run --detached-id … -- <cmd>`
//! re-exec path. babysit drives that argv and may pass flags this version does
//! not know; it MUST tolerate unknown flags (forward-compat), which is the
//! opposite of clap's strict rejection. main.rs shortcuts it BEFORE clap parses.
