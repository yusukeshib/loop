//! `looop client` — a minimal, non-agent TUI for answering worker asks.
//!
//! looop's steering surface is the `looop _ …` CONTRACT. The RECOMMENDED client
//! is an AGENT concierge — start any coding agent and tell it to "work as a
//! concierge for the `looop` command" — that watches for asks, relays them to
//! the human in plain language with a recommendation, and drives the
//! `_ answer` / `_ goal` / `_ playbook` verbs. This command is the humble,
//! hand-driven alternative: a TUI where the pending ask list is ALWAYS on
//! screen and the human answers each ask themselves.
//!
//! It is deliberately less capable than the concierge (no plain-language
//! framing, no recommendation, no steering) — that's the point. Its job is to
//! make looop's design legible: the loop decides and acts on its own; the ONE
//! thing it defers to a human is a worker's blocking ask, and this window is
//! that human ⇄ mailbox channel, laid bare.
//!
//! The ask list is a full-width TABLE (id · age · worker state · options ·
//! prompt preview). Opening an ask (ENTER/click) floats a scrollable DETAIL
//! pane over the right; ESC closes it back to the list — mirroring `looop
//! watch`, where the log fills the screen and the picker floats on top:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ID          AGE  STATE    PROMPT        ┌─ triage-2 ─────────────┐
//! > triage-2    2m   running  flaky test…   │ worker: triage       ┃ │
//!   deploy-3    0s   running  dep upgrade…  │                      ┃ │
//!                                           │ <the question>       │ │
//!                                           │ options: ship, hold  │ │
//!                                           ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
//!                                           │ › ship█              │ │
//!                                           └──────────────────────┘
//!    type answer · enter send · ↑/↓ scroll · esc close    (footer)
//! ```
//!
//! The list is borderless (like watch's log) so the bordered detail pane reads
//! as floating on top; wheel + click + scrollbar-drag all work. The input is
//! pinned along the pane's bottom and focused the moment the pane opens — no
//! extra keystroke to "reveal" it.
//!
//! Read + one narrow write: it lists pending asks (`mailbox::pending`) and, on
//! submit, durably resolves the selected one (`mailbox::answer`). It never
//! spawns a worker or edits policy — for that, use the agent concierge or the
//! raw `_` verbs.
