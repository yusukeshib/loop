//! `looop client` — THE human TUI over a running loop: live session logs,
//! pending asks, and an always-available input line, in one window.
//!
//! The control loop is invisible by design (the pulse + workers run detached),
//! so `client` is the human window into it:
//!
//!   ┌─ log ──────────────────────────────┬ ⚑ 1 ask — a ┐
//!   │ live, COLORED tail of the selected session's      │
//!   │ output.log (ANSI/SGR preserved via ansi-to-tui)   │
//!   ├┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┤
//!   │ answer triage-2 › ship it█                        │
//!   └─ footer ──────────────────────────────────────────┘
//!
//! Three surfaces:
//!
//!   * The LOG fills the screen (the vt100 replay inherited from the old
//!     `looop watch`): scroll reaches the session's first line, ENTER floats
//!     the session picker, `a` cycles its filter.
//!   * A floating ⚑ BADGE (top-right) appears the moment any ask is pending,
//!     so a blocked worker is impossible to miss; `a` jumps to it.
//!   * ONE input line is pinned above the footer and can ALWAYS send
//!     something to the selected session: when that session has a pending ask
//!     the line is an ANSWER (submits `mailbox::answer`, durable); otherwise
//!     it TYPES into the worker's PTY (`session::send_text`, plus Enter) —
//!     the same two channels a human drives via `_ answer` / `_ send`.
//!
//! Focus is modal but shallow: the log owns the keys by default (vim-ish
//! scrolling); `i`/Tab (or a click on the input) focuses the input, ESC/Tab
//! returns. While the input is focused and an ask is pending, the ask's
//! prompt/ref/options float above the input so you answer with the question —
//! and the worker's log — in view.
//!
//! The PTY-backed `output.log` is a RAW transcript — an interactive agent
//! redraws in place (cursor moves, line/screen clears, carriage returns) — so
//! we replay the WHOLE log through a `vt100` virtual terminal and render the
//! resulting SCREEN plus its scrollback, instead of dumping every redraw frame
//! as new lines.
//!
//! Mouse capture stays on (wheel scrolls, the scrollbar scrubs); hold Shift
//! while dragging to use the terminal's own text selection / copy.
